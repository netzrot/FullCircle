  <center class="about">
    <p>During the 2016 presidential election, there was a lot of talk about the political bubbles we all find ourselves in. This website is an attempt to burst that bubble. I wanted to create a simple tool to show the way in which liberal and conservative news cover the same topics differently, how they stress certain aspects and ignore others based on their political affilication. I also wanted to show which stories get the most attention on the respective websites.</p>

    <p>For this early prototype, I based my selection of left and right news sources on <a href="https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/about-bias" target="_top">AllSideâ€™s bias rating</a>. The Associated Press was included as a centrists news source.</p>

    <p>I hope this website helps readers navigate the news and be more aware of the media bias. I also hope that journalists find it useful in their work and to be reminded of their own biases.</p>
